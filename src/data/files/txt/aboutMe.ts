const value: string = `Welcome!

My name is Oscar Childs and I am a Software Developer based in Derbyshire, UK.

I am a Full Stack developer with experience across Front and Backend, with my main strengths being C# (.Net), SQL Server and VueJS. I have experience with Java, Typescript and Blazor. Right now I'm spending my time exploring Vue3 + Vite + Typescript, which is how this site is built!

When I'm not spending my time programming something cool, I'm spending time with my family (our little one just turned one!), trying to improve my 5k time, watching some form of motor racing (will always love F1, but I'm waiting to talk to someone about BTCC!), or trying to catch up with my video game backlog.

Take a look inside my 'desktop' folder to find links to my linkedIn, where you can learn a little more about me and get in touch, and my Github, where you can find the latest code for this website and some of my other projects.

This site is a constant work in progress so bear with me while I get things tidied up.

Thank you for taking the time to look around. I'm really enjoying building this site!`
